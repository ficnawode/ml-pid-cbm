In this submodule, the packages for comparing the results from gaussian fitting are placed.

### submodules:

The structure is similar to normal, multiclass version of the package:

* train_model - this one is missing, as "training", the Gaussian fitting was performed using https://github.com/HeavyIonAnalysis/Pid
* validate_gauss - validates and selects appropriate purity
* validate_multiple_binary_models - connects results from multiple gauss models
